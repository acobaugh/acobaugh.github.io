I'm currently an IT systems engineer (official title "Systems Design Specialist") working for The Pennsylvania State University, main campus. I've been doing IT since 2004. I started a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in Fall 2003, but never finished.

My professional interests are around distributed systems, configuration management, automation, monitoring, distributed filesystems, cloud computing, immutable infrastructure, infrastructure as code, and IPv6 evangelism. (And yes, you just won buzzword bingo, but I'm trying to keep this short)

Currently I'm doing R&D around Amazon AWS, Microsoft AzureStack, Joyent Triton, FreeBSD, Terraform, Packer, Docker, and Kubernetes. I also have lingering operational responsibilities around the University's central Kerberos realms, CFEngine for managing our on-prem Linux systems, logging (ELK, syslog), metrics (InfluxDB+Grafana), monitoring (Nagios), and the University's central filesystem (IBM GPFS + Samba + NFS).

For fun, I enjoy welding, fabrication, machining, machine restoration (lathes, milling machines, tractors, motorcycles, etc), firearms, playing with high voltage, and riding and working on motorcycles (Honda inline 4s, specifically).

I also hold the amateur radio callsign KB3EWY.
