I'm a systems engineer of ~15 years recently turned software engineer working for The Pennsylvania State University, main campus. I've been doing IT since 2004. I started a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in Fall 2003, but never finished.

My professional interests are around distributed systems, configuration management, automation, monitoring, metrics, cloud computing, immutable infrastructure, infrastructure as code, containers, Kerberos, LDAP, and IPv6 evangelism.

Currently I'm helping to maintain microservices and the environment they operate in, writing the occasional Go tool or hacking on existing code, building CI pipelines, and writing Terraform modules.

[For fun](https://labs.cobaugh.io), I enjoy welding, fabrication, machining, machine restoration (lathes, milling machines, tractors, motorcycles, etc), firearms, playing with high voltage, and riding and working on motorcycles (Honda inline 4s, specifically). 

I'm also a volunteer for the local historical railroad where I maintain our website, as well as help with maintenance of way activities, rolling stock maintenance, ticket sales, and excursion operations. I hope to become certified as a locomotive engineer in 2018 with the return of our Budd Rail Diesel Car, which is currently undergoing restoration.

I hold a general class amateur radio license, callsign KB3EWY. I'm not active much, but when I am I'm on 2M FM, 2M APRS, 10M SSB, and 10M FT8..
